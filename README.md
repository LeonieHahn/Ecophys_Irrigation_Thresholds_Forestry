## Ecophysiologically driven irrigation scheduling for safeguarding reforestation efforts in drought-prone calamity areas in Central Europe

This repository contains a {targets} pipeline to reproduce the data analysis, results and figures from Hahn et al. (2025).

#### Running the Code
The analysis is organized as a {targets} pipeline, which works similarly to running each analysis step in the correct order. The main script `_targets.R` starts the pipeline.
Depending on your R setup, additional package installations may be necessary.
